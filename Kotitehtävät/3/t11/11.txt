Modify the program to open large image in a modal* when <article> is clicked. (6p)

kick yourself at this point if you used innerHTML to create the <article> and its content.


add the following html code between </div> and </body>

<dialog>
   <span>&#x2715;</span>
   <img>
</dialog>

picArray has two images for each item: medium and large.
Medium is used in the <img> inside the <article> and large is used in the <img> inside the <dialog>.

use showModal() and close() functions to show and hide <dialog>
the same time you are opening the modal, you should put the large image to the <img> in the modal.

Don't forget to add alt attribute.
use <span> inside <dialog> to close the modal.



* A modal is a dialog box/popup window that is displayed on top of the current page
